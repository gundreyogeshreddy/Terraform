Terraform is a infrastructure as a code tool created by HashiCorp.Terraform is one tool that can automate our resources on any cloud provider.

* Terraform life cycle :

1.terraform init :

The terraform init command initializes a working directory containing terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new terraform configuration file or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.

2.terraform plan :

The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which lets us preview the changes that terraform plans to make to our infrastructure.


3.terraform apply :

Apply makes the changes defined by our plan to create, update, or destroy resources on the any cloud provider.



4.terraform destroy
